//! Host contract: the services an embedder provides to the core.
//!
//! Decryption is the store implementor's concern — the core receives
//! ready-to-use secret material and never sees a cipher. `gproxy-app`
//! implements envelope encryption inside its store; a bare embedder may
//! store plaintext.
//!
//! Every async method returns the workspace [`BoxFuture`]: object-safe,
//! `Send` on native by construction, no async-fn-in-trait. Public traits
//! do not use AFIT anywhere in this workspace — the one-box-per-I/O-call
//! cost is noise next to the I/O itself, and it settles the Send-bound
