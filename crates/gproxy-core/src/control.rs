//! The control-plane read model and execution plans.

//! Tier 2 resolves a request into a [`Plan`] through the [`ControlPlane`]
//! trait — `gproxy-app` implements it over its ArcSwap snapshot, an
//! embedder over static config. An embedder may also skip resolution
//! entirely and hand [`crate::Core::execute_planned`] a `Plan` it built
//! itself; both entries end in the same engine.
