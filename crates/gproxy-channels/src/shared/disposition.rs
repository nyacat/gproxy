//! How provider status policy and structured errors map onto failover.
//!
//! The two policies differ on one wire fact: whether the provider reports a
//! dead credential with 402/403, or reserves those for per-request refusals a
//! live credential can still hit. Picking the wrong one either burns a working
//! credential on a content-policy block, or keeps retrying a revoked one.
//! Recognized error metadata refines either policy; an absent or unrecognized
//! error code leaves the provider's status contract in charge.
